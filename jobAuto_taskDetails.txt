**Goal: Design a Workday “sub-page scraper + form-mapper”**

##List of Tasks:
1. **Sign in** 
    to an existing Workday candidate account.
2. **Traverse at least 2 reachable sub-pages** 
    in a given application flow (e.g., “My Information → Job Application → EEO → Review”), stopping only when no new internal links remain.
3. For each page, **locate every form control** 
    (inputs, textareas, dropdowns, single-select & multi-select radio / checkbox sets, date pickers, file uploads, etc.) 
4. **Return a structured JSON list** 
    where each element looks like:
    ```python
    {
        "label": "<visible question>",
        "id_of_input_component": "<DOM id|name|data-automation-id>",
        "required": <bool>,
        "type_of_input": "text" | "textarea" | "select" | "multiselect" | "checkbox" | "radio" | "date" | "file" | "dropdown",
        "options": [<visible choices>]          # only for select / multiselect / radio / checkbox
        "user_data_select_values": [<example values chosen arbitrarily for test-filling>]
    }
    ```

    Example output slice:
    ```python
    [
        {
            "label": "Are you legally authorized to work in the United States? (Yes/No)",
            "id_of_input_component": "d2e33fec-0aae-4823-9799-d880ee978e64_98488bb7-70fd-4940-92e5-f3f97b7e4289",
            "required": true,
            "type_of_input": "multiselect",
            "options": ["Yes", "No"],
            "user_data_select_values": ["Yes"]
        },
        {
            "label": "Will you now or in the future require sponsorship for employment visa status (e.g., H-1B, TN, etc.)?",
            "id_of_input_component": "d2e33fec-0aae-4823-9799-d880ee978e64_c6227542-3adf-446a-8216-ccd71935a0b0",
            "required": true,
            "type_of_input": "multiselect",
            "options": ["Yes", "No"],
            "user_data_select_values": ["No"]
        }
    ]
    ```
5. **Use these workpages as your testbed** to fill the job application

6. Repeatable playwright workflow

### Deliverables
    * Clean, well-commented script(s).
    * Read-me covering setup, environment vars for credentials, and how to run against any Workday tenant URL.

### Success criteria
    * Script logs in, crawls, and outputs JSON for at least 95 % of controls on a test tenant without manual tweaks.
    * Handles dynamic “Start typing…” combo-boxes, date pickers, file uploads, and hidden/disabled fields gracefully.
    * No brittle x-paths; rely on Workday’s `data-automation-id`, visible labels, or semantic roles.






In simple terms can you design a process which genralises the extraction of sub-pages on workday. Meaning you can signin to an existing account and go through as many pages as you can, find the elements and convert them into: (a list of elements)
Keep in mind the different element types and the options for the dropdowns and multiselect checkboxes. Values can be arbitrary for filling.
We need a web-automation engineer to build a repeatable Playwright (or equivalent) workflow that can:
